## 🌿 About Us
The Townsville Bushwalking Club (TBC) has been bringing people together to enjoy the outdoors since its founding in May 1960.  
Our members range from beginners to seasoned adventurers, united by a passion for:
- Day hikes and extended treks
- Off-track exploration and navigation
- Overseas trips
- Conservation, stewardship, and Leave No Trace principles

We run regular walks, trips, and social events that help people connect with nature, build skills, and discover new corners of North Queensland.
